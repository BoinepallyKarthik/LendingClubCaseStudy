## Introduction

### Project Details

> This case study involves a data science project that utilizes the Lending Club dataset to predict the likelihood of loan default.

### Project Background

> Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and medical procedure financing. The company provides borrowers with easy access to loans at lower interest rates through a convenient online platform. Similar to other lending institutions, granting loans to "risky" applicants poses a significant financial risk known as credit loss. Credit loss refers to the amount of money lost by the lender when borrowers fail to repay or abscond with the owed funds. Essentially, borrowers who default on their loans cause the most substantial losses to the lenders. In this case, customers labeled as "charged-off" are considered defaulters.

### Project Objective

> The goal of this project is to identify the key factors that contribute to defaulted loans, which represent a major source of loss for the company.

### Dataset

> The dataset used for this project is a CSV file containing loan data from Lending Club.

## Conclusions

- Major Factors Influencing Default Probability and Mitigating Credit Loss:
  1. Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
  2. Loan Grades
  3. Verification Status
  4. Annual Income
  5. Number of Public Record Bankruptcies

- Additional Considerations for Default Analysis:
  1. Borrowers from densely populated urban areas such as California, New York, Texas, Florida, etc.
  2. Borrowers with annual incomes in the range of $50,000 to $100,000
  3. Borrowers with a history of public record bankruptcies
  4. Borrowers with lower grades (E, F, G) indicating higher risk
  5. Borrowers with high Debt-to-Income ratios
  6. Borrowers with 10+ years of work experience
